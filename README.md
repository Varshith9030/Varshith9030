As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I am deeply committed to protecting digital environments and addressing cyber threats. I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science, with a specialization in Cybersecurity and Blockchain Technology at Lovely Professional University (LPU), and I aim to build a successful career in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

I have achieved several certifications, including the CompTIA Network+ certification, Red Hat System Administration I from Red Hat Academy, and completion of the Udemy Network+ course. These credentials have provided me with a solid grounding in network security, system administration, and best practices in cybersecurity.

Throughout my academic experience, I have gained practical knowledge in areas such as Networks, Security, Cryptography, and Digital Forensics. I continuously seek to enhance my understanding and keep abreast of the latest developments and challenges in the industry.

I am looking for opportunities in cybersecurity where I can utilize my skills to safeguard digital assets, evaluate vulnerabilities, and help create more secure cyber environments.

I would love to connect and work together to make a positive difference in the cybersecurity landscape!
